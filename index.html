          <p class="text-white-50">We are a group of engineers and scientists who wanted to change the way people drink Gin. Gin is an increasingly popular drink of choice, with the distilleries using copper and glass to create a sophisticated atmosphere. Our vision was to bring the distillery experience to a bar, but without the long waiting times.</p>

          <p class="text-black-50">To infuse and flavour gin normally takes around 3 days, making it a slow and expensive process. Our machine reduces this time to a mere 2 minutes. Numerous stages are used to imitate a chemistry set-up and add to the user experience. A variety of flavours are available, with syringes being used to administer the syrup to enhance the user experience and further induce the illusion of a chemistry experiment. This allows bars to offer more flavours of gin at minimal extra cost. The use of copper and glass mimics the aesthetic of a traditional gin distillery, making the device an attractive addition to any bar.</p>

            <h4>Rotational Motion</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The flavour syrup is contained in syringes in the main compartment of the machine. These syringes rotate according to the flavour combination chosen. This rotational motion is achieved using a stepper motor to ensure an appropriate level of accuracy is achieved. This mechanism is contained within the product’s casing to ensure nothing can get caught in it during use, meaning it is safe to have on the bar top.</p>

            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The gin and tonic water are moved around the machine using pumps and silicone tubing. The end of the tubing can simply be placed into the bottles and the precise amount of fluid will be transferred to the glass. This ensures accurate pouring, reducing the costs of wastage and spillage in bars. Using silicone tubing allows consumers to watch the fluid move through the system without using a breakable material, meaning a safer bar-top system.</p>

The website code was written in Atom, using some helpful snippets and templates from startbootstrap.com and other similar sources. Github was used as a way to run the code and view it in Safari to consider the web view. It also allowed for comments and descriptions to be left on each change made, which meant a more organised design process. Finally, Safari was used to decide what details needed changing and easily navigate to the correct part of the code to edit. It also allowed the website to be viewed on different device screen sizes, to ensure adaptability and usability. </p>

Once a free domain name has been chosen, it must be registered. This involves giving relevant information that is required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which is the governing body for domain names. If false information is entered, the domain name can be cancelled. To set it up a web host is required, and this is normally who the domain name is registered through. A monthly plan must be chosen with the host and then a website can be published online.</p>

                      <p>A good website should be easy to navigate and understand. This means a clear layout and not too much information in a small space or it becomes hard to follow. The order of pages should make logical sense and all pages should have links to each other. Aesthetics are also extremely important as the font, text colour and size must be suitable for the images and background used so that all text is legible. Finally, a good website should guide the users’ eyes to the key points and images to ensure it delivers all the important information it needs to.</p>

                      <p>Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services or environments for people with disabilities. For websites, this means ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with disabilities. Methods of achieving this include: alternative text for images, keyboard input for users who cannot use the mouse, transcripts for audio, enlarging text and removing flashing content. There are a large number of sources online that give further recommendations and so this should be consulted for any content that isn’t covered by the general considerations mentioned above.</p>

                      <p>GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation. There have been some key changes recently, including: the conditions for consent have been strengthened; users must be notified about a breach within 72 hours of the breach being discovered; users have a right to know if data concerning them is being processed, where and what for; if a user so chooses it then all their personal information must be erased; data protection must be included from the beginning of designing a system; and data protection officers (DPO) are required to keep an internal record. For this website, if any information was asked for then a clear message asking for consent and detailing the terms and conditions would be necessary. This should then be organised by a DPO and it should be possible to erase a single person’s data from the system upon request, which means it should be easy for someone to request the removal of their personal data. Finally, an alert system should be set up to allow users to be contacted if there is a breach of data.

                      <p>To successfully market my website there are a number of options. Firstly, search engine optimisation, which is the process of optimising pages with keywords and phrases that people are likely to search. This means that the websites visibility in search engines’ organic results in increased. Another similar technique is to pay to be advertised at the top of a search engine’s page, known as paying per click. Furthermore, a targeting cookie can be placed on viewers’ computers to show advertisements of the website once they leave the page. However, because of GDPR and the recent changes, users must be given the opportunity to consent to the cookie. In continuation, paying for advertising slots on social media, such as Facebook and YouTube. Finally, customer satisfaction will increase the number of people looking at the website. This means that the first customers may just be the most important because if the first review is negative then no new customers will want to buy from the company.

                      <p>With more time, I would add a section to allow purchasing of the product online or at least the ability to ask for a quote. This would mean that the website can be a one-stop service for consumers so that they don’t have to travel to a shop. It might also be useful to make the navigation bar a drop-down menu so that the top of the website doesn’t become too crowded and it is easier to use. Moreover, I would like to make a completely unique website in its aesthetic, rather than using pre-made templates. This would take too long for this project as I have no experience with making websites from before this, but it would allow for a website that is very personal to the brand and for more customisation. To do this would require doing an online course in website design and coding, as well as drawing out a detailed website design before starting to code it. Finally, including more interactive features for users, such as videos, links and audio clips. This would make the website more of an experience and could allow the user to feel more of a connection with the product.
